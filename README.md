### Project Description
This project is a React-based web app that allows users to submit a form with personal details, then view a custom image slider showcasing different images based on user inputs. It incorporates routing for smooth navigation and form validation to ensure data accuracy.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

This app solves the "problem" of helping users feel like their personal details are matched with totally irrelevant and random images. Because who doesn‚Äôt need a form-based matchmaking system that pairs your age and height with a random, rotating selection of unrelated photos? It's the perfect blend of pointlessness and personality!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We‚Äôre tackling the issue by taking your info and thoughtfully ignoring it! Instead, we present you with a rotating gallery of unrelated images that might be your "match." With mandatory fields and random photos, we guarantee an experience that's equally amusing and utterly pointless!
